    "Work to improve the quality of people\u0432\u0402\u2122s lives, which depends primarily on the availability of drinking water, is an ongoing endeavor in Moscow. Special efforts are made to prevent unpleasant odors emanating from various facilities and to reduce emissions into the atmosphere. Water quality is also a priority, with quality matching the level achieved in leading capital cities across the globe.",
    "Water treatment facilities in Moscow use advanced technology to purify drinking water. According to the 2025 plan of the development of the Moscow water supply system, the existing water treatment facilities are undergoing refurbishment and upgrade, with the most effective technologies (above all, ozone sorption) being implemented on a step by step basis. As a water treatment method, ozone sorption is based on a combined use of ozonation and sorption processes for water purification. Depending on the operational diagram, ozonation is takes one or two stages to perform. Powdered or granulated activated carbon is used as a sorbent."
