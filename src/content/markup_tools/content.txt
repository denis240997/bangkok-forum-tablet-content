Electronic prescriptions with a QR code have been prescribed in all city polyclinics since February 2021. Muscovites can get prescription medications by presenting a QR code on the mobile screen. This option is available in all pharmacies of the Department of Health â€“ more than 2.5 thousand pharmacies and pharmacy points participate in the project. Moscow doctors have written out over 35 million electronic prescriptions with a QR code.
In January 2022, a pilot project was launched in Moscow, within the framework of which citizens can now receive preferential medicines not only in pharmacies of the Moscow Department of Health, but also in commercial pharmacies using electronic prescriptions. It is important that, if desired, the patient will be able to pay extra and take another trade name. Over 350 commercial pharmacies have joined the project.
