To improve efficiency and quality of interaction between the capital city’s authorities and businesses, an investment portal was launched in 2014 with the backing of the Moscow Government: https://investmoscow.ru/. For ten years, it has remained one of the most popular specialized resources for businesses. More than 72,000 personal accounts have been registered on the website over time. Entrepreneurs have access to 30 online services on the investment portal. These services facilitate getting support measures sponsored by the city, reduce interaction time, help find platforms, partners and information necessary for the implementation of investment projects. In late 2020, the Moscow Investor service was launched on the investment portal. Using that service as a one-stop shop, Moscow businessmen can submit their questions and proposals regarding investment activities in the capital city and receive answers to their personal accounts within short timeframes. For the sake of convenience, a mobile application was launched in order to make services of the investment portal more readily accessible for the users. Using their smartphone, they can file an application, get information about the city’s property and select the most suitable sites, read industry-related news and check the status of their applications in the personal cabinet. Moreover, the investment portal has a section called “Industry,” which helps manufacturers find a facility where they potentially can organize their production. In addition, registered users of the portal now have access to a map of integrated development of territories, a list of the latest technological developments, as well as current industry news.
