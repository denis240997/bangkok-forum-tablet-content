According to the 2025 plan of the development of the Moscow water supply system, the existing water treatment facilities are undergoing refurbishment and upgrade, with the most effective technologies (above all, ozone sorption) being implemented on a step by step basis. As a water treatment method, ozone sorption is based on a combined use of ozonation and sorption processes for water purification. Depending on the operational diagram, ozonation is takes one or two stages to perform. Powdered or granulated activated carbon is used as a sorbent."

The service boasts a monthly audience of 1 million people. Water meters register actual water consumption, and people pay for the amount actually consumed. In order to encourage citizens to save water and draw their attention to the problem of sustainable use of natural resources, the service coverage was expanded and the following features were added to the existing service in 2021: charts and comparisons (users can see a visualized analysis of water consumption in comparison with the average figures for the city); emotional reinforcement (e.g., if water consumption goes down, the service will send a notification with a positive emoji); tips on how to reduce water consumption. In addition, the users are encouraged to take an interactive test that will help them find out how economically water is used in the house. Based on its results, tips are offered on how to avoid unnecessary water consumption.",

The key idea was to show how much effort and energy is actually spent on bringing water to households. In an interactive format, the users walked the entire path of a drop of water, from the moment it enters a body of water to the minute it reaches the faucet in their apartment. A special QR code was printed on the back side of the Unified Payment Document, a receipt for housing and utility services. (Twelve million papers were printed in total.) Scanning the code with a smartphone camera launched an interactive presentation with elements of augmented reality. With the help of AR, different stages of water treatment are shown, as water gets purified and becomes potable. The user is invited to \u0432\u0402\u045alaunch\u0432\u0402\u045c the process of preparing water for supply to households, e.g., to start the purification procedure, open the pumps and taps."

For ten years, it has remained one of the most popular specialized resources for businesses. More than 72,000 personal accounts have been registered on the website over time. Entrepreneurs have access to 30 online services on the investment portal. These services facilitate getting support measures sponsored by the city, reduce interaction time, help find platforms, partners and information necessary for the implementation of investment projects. In late 2020, the Moscow Investor service was launched on the investment portal. Using that service as a one-stop shop, Moscow businessmen can submit their questions and proposals regarding investment activities in the capital city and receive answers to their personal accounts within short timeframes. For the sake of convenience, a mobile application was launched in order to make services of the investment portal more readily accessible for the users. Using their smartphone, they can file an application, get information about the city\u0432\u0402\u2122s property and select the most suitable sites, read industry-related news and check the status of their applications in the personal cabinet. Moreover, the investment portal has a section called \u0432\u0402\u045aIndustry,\u0432\u0402\u045c which helps manufacturers find a facility where they potentially can organize their production.
