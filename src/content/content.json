According to the 2025 plan of the development of the Moscow water supply system, the existing water treatment facilities are undergoing refurbishment and upgrade, with the most effective technologies (above all, ozone sorption) being implemented on a step by step basis. As a water treatment method, ozone sorption is based on a combined use of ozonation and sorption processes for water purification. Depending on the operational diagram, ozonation is takes one or two stages to perform. Powdered or granulated activated carbon is used as a sorbent."

The service boasts a monthly audience of 1 million people. Water meters register actual water consumption, and people pay for the amount actually consumed. In order to encourage citizens to save water and draw their attention to the problem of sustainable use of natural resources, the service coverage was expanded and the following features were added to the existing service in 2021: charts and comparisons (users can see a visualized analysis of water consumption in comparison with the average figures for the city); emotional reinforcement (e.g., if water consumption goes down, the service will send a notification with a positive emoji); tips on how to reduce water consumption. In addition, the users are encouraged to take an interactive test that will help them find out how economically water is used in the house. Based on its results, tips are offered on how to avoid unnecessary water consumption.",

The key idea was to show how much effort and energy is actually spent on bringing water to households.

A special QR code was printed on the back side of the Unified Payment Document, a receipt for housing and utility services. (Twelve million papers were printed in total.) Scanning the code with a smartphone camera launched an interactive presentation with elements of augmented reality. With the help of AR, different stages of water treatment are shown, as water gets purified and becomes potable. The user is invited to \u201claunch\u201d the process of preparing water for supply to households, e.g., to start the purification procedure, open the pumps and taps.",

In late 2020, the Moscow Investor service was launched on the investment portal. Using that service as a one-stop shop, Moscow businessmen can submit their questions and proposals regarding investment activities in the capital city and receive answers to their personal accounts within short timeframes. For the sake of convenience, a mobile application was launched in order to make services of the investment portal more readily accessible for the users. Using their smartphone, they can file an application, get information about the city\u2019s property and select the most suitable sites, read industry-related news and check the status of their applications in the personal cabinet. Moreover, the investment portal has a section called \u201cIndustry,\u201d which helps manufacturers find a facility where they potentially can organize their production.

                        "In turn, the city gives investors an opportunity to make significant savings and increase their income in the future. For the creation of additional jobs, developers receive from the city a benefit on payment for changing the type of permitted use of land for the construction of a residential building. As a result, the investor will be receiving income not only from the sale of apartments, but also from the construction of a new commercial facility.",
                        "By now, the city has entered into 33 agreements with developers. Under these agreements, the developers will build 76 properties which will employ more than 56,600 people. A record number of agreements were signed in 2022. There were 17 of them, which is almost twice as many as in previous years.",
                        "Under all the signed agreements, investors will build 47 educational institutions, 10 office centers, nine modern industrial complexes, four retail-and-office buildings and shopping malls, as well as a sports facility and an art museum.",
                        "The implementation of the projects will require an investment of 152 billion rubles, and upon commissioning of the facilities, more than 56,600 new jobs will be created in the city. Most of the new workplaces, or over 40,400, will be located in office premises and commercial buildings.",
                        "The peak of investment activity occurred in late November and early December 2022. In that period, the city signed nine agreements with developers on creation of workplaces. Investors will build 16 educational institutions, an innovation center, an art museum, two industrial complexes, and three office buildings. These facilities will generate more than 19,700 jobs for the city.",
                        "This type of cooperation is beneficial for both the city and the investor: The program not only addresses employment issues but also reduces commuting and the burden on the roads, with the investors getting an opportunity to make significant savings and increase their income in the future.",
                        "The workplace program is popular with developers. Some of the investors who previously entered into agreements with Moscow continue to come up with new projects and also bring existing ones to the next level by expanding their facilities and/or investing additional funds in creating new workplaces.",
                        "The terms of the program are improved on an ongoing basis and broadened depending on the needs of the developers and the current economic situation. This year, an opportunity emerged to increase the scope of benefits. For this purpose, it is necessary to reduce the period of workplace creation. If that period is cut by 6 to 12 months, the benefit will increase by 5%, and with a reduction of 12 months upwards, it will increase by 10%.",
                        "Also in 2022, we expanded the list of facilities that make investors eligible for a benefit. Facilities providing complex logistics services have been added to the list.",
                        "In addition, from this year onward, developers may involve more co-contractors in their projects. Previously, the investor and the involved party\u2019s memberships were to have at least a 75-percent match; now the requirement has been reduced to 51 percent.",
                        "Another novelty: an increase in the time limit for the creation of jobs inside a residential buildings. Previously, it was from three to six years, depending on the size of the building, and now the contract will remain valid until the completion of construction of an apartment building.",
                        "Changes have also affected the factors that affect the calculation of the scope of benefits. For all districts of the Russian capital city, a single factor was introduced, which determines the scope of benefit for cultural facilities, social infrastructure and inpatient medical facilities. For schools, children daycare centers and outpatient clinics that factor will apply if workplaces are created on the same grounds with a residential compound.",
